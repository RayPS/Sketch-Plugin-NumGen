# Sketch-Plugin---NumGen

When you work with repetitive data, (e.g. data table), if you simply copy and paste the rows, all the numbers will be the same, which is not realistic. This plugin generates random formatted numbers that are: CTR, clicks, costs, impr. But you can modify the js files to include whatever kind of number you need.
